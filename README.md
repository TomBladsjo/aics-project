## Project description

This project (with the working title 'All humans are human, but some ethnicities are more ethnic than others') investigates how reporting bias (that is, the tendency of people to mention things they consider relevant or surprising but omit information that is obvious or can be guessed from context) affects model behavior with regards to marginalized ethnicities. 
I demonstrate that both models are significantly more surprised to see ethnicity mentioned in captions for images depicting white people than for images depicting non-white people. 
This supports the hypothesis that the models encode a perspective where whiteness is considered the default for humans. 

For more information on the project and the experiment, see the [project report](https://github.com/TomBladsjo/aics-project/blob/master/paper/aics_paper.pdf). 
The relevant code can be found in `/code/test_transformers.ipynb`.
